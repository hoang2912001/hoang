    Grooveling around an empty crater in the middle of L
     Corp's decrepit Nest, Zena of the 'Arbiter of the Head'
      exclaims apperant frustration at the sudden
       disappearance of a so called 'The Library'.
        "The Claw, The Eye and the Head are trying
    their best to-" Said Zena, stuttering over the
    splutter of a crystaline-like object lodged in
     her chest. "-Excuse me, have been dealing with
      an excessive threat called the 'Library'
       which threatened the existence of the City itself.
        However unfortunate the disappearance of this 
        institution is, we are proud as one of the 
        Wings of the city to expel them."
         She finished, before disappearing and 
         ghosting our reporters on the spot. Citizens
          inside the City are now in an uproar, and 
          are demanding better public infrastructure
           systems.
